--------- Bases ---------
Best : SplitMax

-------- Splitter -------
Best : adaptative (or random if lucky)

---- Metaheuristics: ----

1) Local search:
SD/SI : SD best, best than Splitmax solo except on 4,6,8 data
random : not enought good // SD
modular : really not good or even // SD
adaptative : relatively best results except 3

2) recuit: (parameter impact not really relevant)
SD : results a bit bit bit better than SD solo
modular : not really good or even // SD
adaptative : results a bit less good than SD solo (really bad on 2 and 6)

3) tabou: (N useless, greatest threshold give better solution)
SD : not really good or even // SD
adaptative : best than SD (and SD tabou, so)
